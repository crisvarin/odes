# odes


This package implements an approach to forecasting count time series with a form of exponential smoothing built from observation-driven models of Davis, Dunsmuir and Streett (2003). The methodology is discussed in Karlis, Pedeli and Varin (2023).

## Installation

You can install the development version of odes from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("crisvarin/odes", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Example

This is a basic example showing how to use odes for disease surveillance:
```{r example}
library(odes)
example(surveillance.odes)
```

The package vignette expands on the previous example by allowing the results discussed in Section 4 of Karlis, Pedeli, and Varin (2023) to be fully 
replicated:
```{r}
# To view the vignette type
# vignette("odes")
```
